Year: 2040
Location: Earth

There is an asteroid on a collision course with Earth estimated to impact within the next 18 months. It will likely cause mass global extinction of many species and potentially bring an end to human life and civilization as we know it.

For the first time in Earth's history every nation has come together to find a solution to this global problem. You've been elected to head the efforts on how to save the cradle of civilization. It's up to you to decide how humanity lives or dies. Choose wisely!

- blow up the asteroid
- colonize another planet
- deflect the asteroid
- build shelters and stock up food before the impact
- party for the net year and a half


** all of these will require global cooperation (money, warfare, corruption, famine, disease )
