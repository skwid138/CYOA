# CYOA
Choose Your Own Adventure Game - [name]

### What is this about?
Building a Choose Your Own Adventure Game.  But Also, building up knowledge on git branches, clones...all that in re: GitHub

### What the game will do
Each player will begin with a story, outlining the background to the game.  The user will be prompted if they want to continue or not, if yes, game will begin.  If not, game ends/cuts to one alternate ending.

With player continuing, the player will navigate through various choose your own adventure options.  Ideally this gets more and more complex, but possibly at first just has a few rough drafts of scenes.

User will input strings, numbers, and booleans to advance through the game.

### Language(s) used:
Based in JavaScript

### Ideal elements used in creating game:
Garrett:

Finding a way to either link to text files OR (even more ideally) link to one outside text file which directs to a specific set of text.  I think Python could do this but I never learned.

Finding way for string inputs to not need to be exact (e.g. potentially allowing spelling mistakes?)
- The '||' or operator may be useful as well as the '.toLowerCase' method

More than just string inputs to solve problems.  E.g. prompted to solve random math problem, picking a random number, etc.

I'm sure more will be added for ideal things to be used.
